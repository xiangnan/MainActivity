/**
 * Welcome to the world of Android Market licensing. We're so glad to have you
 * onboard!
 * <p>
 * The first thing you need to do is get your hands on your public key.
 * Update the BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY constant below with your encoded public key,
 * which you can find on the
 * <a href="http://market.android.com/publish/editProfile">Edit Profile</a>
 * page of the Market publisher site.
 * <p>
 * Log in with the same account on your Cupcake (1.5) or higher phone or
 * your FroYo (2.2) emulator with the Google add-ons installed. Change the
 * test response on the Edit Profile page, press Save, and see how this
 * application responds when you check your license.
 * <p>
 * After you get this sample running, peruse the
 * <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/licensing.html">
 * licensing documentation.</a>
